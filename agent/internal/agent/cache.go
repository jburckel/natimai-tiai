// stateCache holds the last reading of a slow-cycle block between the goroutine
// that produces it and the heartbeat that ships it.
//
// A block is attached to a heartbeat only when it holds something the server has
// not acknowledged yet. A Windows Update state is a few dozen updates with their
// titles and an inventory is a few hundred programs: re-sending either every 60
// seconds would multiply the parc's heartbeat payload for no new information,
// while re-writing the same rows server-side on every poll.
//
// "Acknowledged" is tracked with a generation counter rather than a boolean, and
// that is the whole point of the type. A collection finishing *between* the
// moment a heartbeat picks up its payload and the moment that heartbeat succeeds
// must not be marked as sent: with a flag it would be, and the fresh reading
// would then sit in the cache until the next cycle — six hours later for updates,
// a day for the inventory.
//
// Generic over the block it holds, because there are two of them now and the
// race is the same race.
