// and whose software has not moved sends nothing at all, so the heartbeat stays
// the size it was before this module existed. The server has its own copy of the
// same check, for the case this one cannot cover — an agent that restarted has
// forgotten what it sent.

// is simply not attached, the server keeps what it had, and the machine still
// reports its Defender state, its session and its address.
