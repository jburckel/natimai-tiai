// (interface metric), and the hardware address it is bound to. Kept out of the
// //go:build windows file so the election stays compilable — and unit-testable

// PrefixLength is the mask that goes with IP, and it is here for the same
// reason: it is the poste's *own* network that the packet has to be broadcast
// on. The server used to assume /24 from a setting, which is wrong on every parc
// addressed in /16 or /22 and right by accident on the others — whereas Windows
// has known the answer all along.
//

//     network, and which no name-based heuristic would catch reliably.

//     Ethernet wins over the Wi-Fi that is still associated.
