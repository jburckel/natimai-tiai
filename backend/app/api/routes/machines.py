    Three signals, strongest first:

    - **SMBIOS UUID** (plan §2.3), the motherboard's own identifier. Only when
      it identifies a single machine: the firmware constants a whitebox ships on
      every unit are excluded, or a batch of forty would each list the other
      thirty-nine as duplicates.
    - **TPM EK hash**, which survives a re-image just as well and is there when
      the SMBIOS anchor is not.
    - **Hostname**, deliberately included although it proves nothing on its own:
      the case that most needs merging — a poste whose anchor drifted, which is
      exactly what the "empreinte divergente" banner reports — leaves no *shared*
      anchor between the two records, so an anchors-only search would answer
      "aucun doublon" on the one page that offers the button. Reported as the
      weak signal it is, never for a poste that reported no hostname at all, and
      **only when the hardware does not contradict it**: two records that each
      carry a real, different SMBIOS UUID or TPM key are two machines, and no
      shared name makes them one.

      That last rule costs one real case to buy a much worse one. It keeps a
      batch of freshly imaged, not-yet-renamed postes — all still answering to
      the image's computer name — from listing each other as candidates for a
      merge that *deletes* a row; and the drift it turns away is the variant
      where both records hold a real anchor, which is indistinguishable from two
      distinct machines by any query. That variant is resolved from the merge
      dialog's manual search instead, deliberately and with both UUIDs on
      screen. The everyday drift — an old record that predates fingerprinting
      and carries no anchor at all — is not contradicted, and is still offered.

    ``machine_guid`` is not a signal here: this fleet's postes are re-imaged
    without Sysprep, which is precisely the case where clones share it — it
    would group a whole image, not the copies of one machine.
