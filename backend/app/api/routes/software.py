"""The parc's software catalogue.

The reason the inventory module is worth building. A fiche answers "what is on
this poste"; this answers "qui a encore Java 8", which is the question an
administrator actually arrives with — and the one a per-machine list of programs
cannot answer at all.

There is deliberately no ``/software/{id}/machines`` here. The machine list
already carries pagination, sorting and a dozen filters, so the drill-down is
``GET /machines?software_id=…`` — the console links straight to a pre-filtered
list, and "qui a Java 8 *et* est allumé" costs nothing extra.
