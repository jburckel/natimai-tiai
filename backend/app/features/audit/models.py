"""Append-only audit log of administrative actions.

Command dispatch already audits itself — every command row carries
``created_by`` and its full lifecycle (command/models.py), wake included. This
table covers the actions that leave *no* row anywhere else: the kill-switch
and its lifting, machine merges (which delete a row), account management.
Entries are written inside the caller's transaction — same rule as the e-mail
outbox: the action and its trace commit or roll back together — and are never
updated or deleted afterwards.
