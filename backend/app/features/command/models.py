    The wire protocol carries the *name* of a type and nothing else: no
    arguments, no command line, no script. The executable and its fixed
    arguments live in the agent's own binary, so even a compromised server can
    only ever trigger an entry of this list — never arbitrary code
    (``plan-commandes-distantes.md`` §1). Adding a command is one value here,
    one row in the agent's table and one entry in the console catalogue; the
    protocol and the schema stay untouched (``type`` is stored as a plain str).

    One value — ``WAKE_ON_LAN`` — is executed by the *server* and never
    delivered to an agent; see its comment below.
