"""Store one reported inventory.

Replacement semantics throughout, like ``windows_update.replace_pending`` and
unlike ``threat.upsert_threats``: what is reported *is* the machine's current
hardware and software, so what is no longer reported has to go. ``first_seen``
is excluded from every update set — it is the only historical fact these tables
carry, and re-reporting the same disk every day must not reset it.
