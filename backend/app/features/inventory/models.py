"""Hardware and software inventory tables.

Current state, not history — the same semantics as ``windows_updates`` and the
opposite of ``threats``: a disk that was pulled, a volume that was deleted, a
program that was uninstalled must *disappear* here, or the console would keep
describing a machine that no longer exists. ``crud`` replaces each set on every
reported inventory; ``first_seen`` is the one historical fact that survives.

What has cardinality one — the chassis, the motherboard, the BIOS, the CPU —
lives in columns on ``machines`` instead. See ``dev/plan-inventaire.md`` §3.

    1. The question this module exists to answer is "qui a encore Java 8", which
       here is a GROUP BY over a few thousand rows instead of a few hundred
       thousand repeated strings;
    2. software deployment, next in the same phase, needs a stable id to hang a
       package on. Adding it now costs a table; adding it later costs a data
       migration over the whole history.

    ``version`` and ``publisher`` are NOT NULL and empty-when-absent on purpose:
    Postgres considers NULLs distinct in a UNIQUE constraint, so a nullable
    publisher would let one unpublished program accumulate a row per machine —
    exactly the duplication the catalogue exists to avoid.

    No name normalisation, deliberately: GLPI and OCS both grew dictionaries to
    fold "Mozilla Firefox" into "Firefox (x64 fr)", and that is a product of its
    own. What the poste declares is what is stored; a dictionary can sit above
    this table later without touching collection.
