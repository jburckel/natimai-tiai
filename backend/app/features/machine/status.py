    Two ways to qualify, because two products can be doing the protecting:

    * a third-party antivirus registered with the Windows Security Center —
      running, and not reporting its signatures as out of date.

    The second path is not a courtesy. Installing ESET or Bitdefender pushes
    Defender into passive mode, which zeroes ``av_enabled``/``rtp_enabled``, so
    without it every third-party-protected machine would count as unprotected
    forever and the dashboard KPIs would be wrong by construction.

    It is deliberately weaker than the Defender path: the Security Center exposes
    no signature version and no date, only a freshness bit that vendors fill in
    unevenly. An *unknown* freshness therefore still qualifies, while an explicit
    "out of date" does not — requiring a positive bit would reinstate the very
