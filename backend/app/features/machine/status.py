``is_up_to_date`` is a derived attribute (plan §4): a machine is up to date when
its antivirus is running and its signatures are fresh — either Defender's, with
real dates, or a third-party product's as the Windows Security Center reports it.
It is computed on each heartbeat and stored, so reads (list, stats) are plain
aggregates.

    Two ways to qualify, because two products can be doing the protecting:

      no older than ``max_age_days``. Missing data is not up to date.
    * a third-party antivirus registered with the Windows Security Center —
      running, and not reporting its signatures as out of date.

    The second path is not a courtesy. Installing ESET or Bitdefender pushes
    Defender into passive mode, which zeroes ``av_enabled``/``rtp_enabled``, so
    without it every third-party-protected machine would count as unprotected
    forever and the dashboard KPIs would be wrong by construction.

    It is deliberately weaker than the Defender path: the Security Center exposes
    no signature version and no date, only a freshness bit that vendors fill in
    unevenly. An *unknown* freshness therefore still qualifies, while an explicit
    "out of date" does not — requiring a positive bit would reinstate the very
    bug this path fixes. Defender's own entry in that registry is ignored here:
    the Defender columns say the same thing with real dates behind them.
