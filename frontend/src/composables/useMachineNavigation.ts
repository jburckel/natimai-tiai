/**
 * Walk the search results from inside a poste's fiche.
 *
 * The list page hands over its whole query plus the row's absolute rank (`i`)
 * when opening a poste. From that, this resolves the neighbours by asking the
 * server for the two single-row pages around `i` — not by carrying the list in
 * a store. The reason is the same one that put pagination server-side: the
 * fleet does not fit in the client, and a fiche reached from a pasted URL or a
 * reloaded tab has no store to read anyway. Two rows per fiche is a cheaper
 * price than a list that is wrong after a refresh.
 *
 * With no `i` in the URL — a fiche opened from the dashboard, a bookmark, a
 * merge redirect — there is no search to walk and everything here is null: the
 * arrows simply do not render.
